Description: IP address/UNIX socket convenience functions for Go
 go-sockaddr is a convenience library that makes doing the right thing with IP
 addresses easy.  go-sockaddr is loosely modeled after the UNIX sockaddr_t and
 creates a union of the family of sockaddr_t types.
 .
 The primary intent of the library was to make it possible
 to define heuristics for selecting the correct IP addresses
 when a configuration is evaluated at runtime.
